# TODO: by Tejas
# Use https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference for reference
# We need to incorperate AI in "education". So if you want we can use gpt API to create a chatbot. 
# It shouldn't take that long cause the api is really easy to use in python.
# Make the page loook good obviously. Here you should really try and use a lot of streamlit features to make something educational
# CREATE A NEW BRANCH
# DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN
# Look at some examples
# Here is some that use LLMS: https://streamlit.io/gallery?category=llms
# Include some nice graphs https://streamlit.io/gallery?category=data-visualization. Its super easy if you chatgpt it or just 
# copy code from the examples. Its all just basic python
