# RecycleAI - The Recycling Companion App

Welcome to RecycleAI, an innovative app designed to revolutionize the way we recycle. With the power of AI, RecycleAI makes recycling more rewarding and educational, contributing to a greener environment.

## How It Works

RecycleAI is a user-friendly app that transforms recycling into a rewarding experience. Here's a step-by-step guide on how it operates:

### Snap a Photo

Start by taking a picture of the item you wish to recycle using your device's camera. Ensure the item is clearly visible for accurate analysis.

### AI Analysis

Upon uploading the photo, RecycleAI utilizes advanced image recognition technology to analyze the item. The AI swiftly identifies the material composition and determines whether the item is recyclable.

### Earn Points

For every recyclable item you scan, RecycleAI awards points. The points are based on the recyclability level of the item, promoting more environmentally-friendly recycling practices.

### Redeem Rewards

Collect points as you recycle and redeem them for exciting, tangible rewards. These rewards are not just incentives but a way to thank you for your contribution to a cleaner planet.
